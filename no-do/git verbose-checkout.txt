* jc/verbose-checkout (2011-10-16) 2 commits
 - checkout -v: give full status output after switching branches
 - checkout: move the local changes report to the end

This is just to leave a record that the reason why we do not do this not
because we are incapable of coding this, but because it is not a good idea
to do this. I suspect people who are new to git that might think they need
it would soon realize the don't.

Will keep in 'pu' as a showcase for a while and then will drop.
