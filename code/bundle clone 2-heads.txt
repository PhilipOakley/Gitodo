Both bundle and clone (and the pack protocol) currently lack a method of indicating which branchname is currently HEAD.

The pack protocol lists HEAD first, so we can add it's name after the null. Curren(old) git will ignore this.

The bundle can be refreshed/refactored to sort the heads list, as per modern pack processing. Then add the same method of adding HEAD's name.


Finally, for the actual ref name that is HEAD we add 'HEAD' behind the null.
