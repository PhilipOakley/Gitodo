filtering refs (negative patterns)
allow parts of ref space to be excluded

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/283350/focus=284769

I'd want to limit blob expansion of refs to one level so that sub-level namesppaces are not included unless explicitly asked.

e.g refs/heads/*^ means that refs/heads/master is found but refs/heads/jh/master is not because its in the /jh/ namespace.
