I think you (like me) have misinterpreted @unutbu's advice: 
1) first you run git rebase master and let it fail; 
2) then you edit version.txt and make it as it should look at that point, and save the edit; 
3) then you git add .../version.txt; <<<<< Add;Add;Add !!!
4) then you do git rebase --continue (**not** 'commit')! 
If rebase --continue succeeds here, it is already committed (no need for git commit here!) - so all that is left to do is git push (if you use a remote repo). 
Hope this helps, if I got it right :) - cheers!
