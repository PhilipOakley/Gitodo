Git TODO code items


add 'git help --pdf' (same as --web/html, but passes the .pdf path to the browser), Git itself doesn't provide the pdf's it's the user/user's admin/distribution's task to create them.

update gitk to highlight changed mode bits if the corefilemode is false (i.e. they can't be trusted) the git gui can easily change them if the user unstage/stages some file to aggregate changes and the 'false modes' are picked up.

Also git Gui to notice (and allow mode change if core.trustfilemode.false.


Doc/update the git rebase messages to say "add/commit resolved issues!" (git-rebase-conflicts-keep-blocking-progress.txt)



Make git Bundle include the refs for pseudo refs (after a null) so that the heuristic for guessing which branch is current HEAD gets better.


split the install/build/deploy steps in the git/Makefile so that "we" can deploy the MSVC-VS08/10/12 compiled code.


Sparse/Narrow clone/checkout, with enhanced ignore patterns. Also Junio's 07 July 2015 18.03 "Re: Whether Git supports directory level access or not"!

create/compile msmtp.exe for the new SDK.
Can't exec "/bin/msmtp.exe": No such file or directory at C:\git-sdk-32\mingw32/libexec/git-core\git-send-email line 1258.


Improve "run-length / clock skew options" (multi-point on curve) (e.g. those who have the wrong year!), so allow a run of (upto) N commits all with very old time stamps as long as they are within say 24hrs/1hr of each other , so a series with wrong clock is accepted, as long as the ones after (DAG earlier) are still within date. 


Check that ther is a 'Timecut' (rather than merge points etc) option for Git Shallow. (see also clock skew)
