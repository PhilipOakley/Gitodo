When creating the new oid length we can create enough space for an alternate oldoid and fixed flag that is long enough not to have much of a collision attack.

|------newoid--------|-type-|
|----flag----|---oldoid-----|


Fixed flag for the oldoid suffix.

The key point for now is the possibility that we can experiment with md5 and sha1 as the pair using the current sha1 sizing!
