sort out the "{apostrophe}" (2 places) that shouldn't be there.

sort out (make clear it's 'default') the definition of the default or all refs under refs/heads and/or refs/tags.

add example with merge commits (multiple + + + on a line, but only one branch named) and explain.

Correct the code to avoid above confusion (and maybe add '|' lines to de-confuse the +++ problem).

May depend on whether the old branches have been deleted.

Point to newer better log methods.
