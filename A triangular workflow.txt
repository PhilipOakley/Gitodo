A triangular workflow is required when the upstream repository is read only, uses a pull request workflow, and your development repository is not accessible by the upstream maintainer. In this case you will need a fork of your repository to publish your contributions that is accessible by the upstream.

The options for creation of the publish fork will depend on the available hosting options. If the upstream is hosted  on a service that allows direct forking then this can be the simplest method.


"Mexican standoff"

In this arrangement there is no 'origin' repository, rather it's 'upstream', 'publish(me)' and 'local'.


The question is : What is the default fetch/pull remote and refspec.

Git.git doesn't use triangular anyway.


possibility for confusion with 'fork as backup' and 'fork as open source (passive publishing)' (c.f. a PR is active publishing)
