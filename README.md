Gitodo (Git-toh-doh, like dojo)
===============================

A repository trying to capture all my ideas
and put them in a rational order with notes etc.

Initially, it is a disordered capture of old notes
and lists.

The tasks are split between those that are coding and those
that are documentation. 

The Done/Done.txt is a
git log --oneline --author=oakley v1.7.12..junio/master >Done.txt
where 889d358 ("Git 1.7.12", 2012-08-19)

The no-do covers items that have been warned away from.
