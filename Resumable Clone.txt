Resumable Clone.

1. New bundle standard extension (.bndl). Add to the list in clone.c

2. cannot see how the code determines if it already has the adjacent pack part, or whether if needs to get the pack again.

3. Perhaps there should be a way of recombining the bundle after getting the pack - the "resumable" capabilities is confusing the "bundle sneakernet" capabilities.

4. somewhat orthogonal, but nearby, unconfuse dual HEADs, is right there in the bundle header / pack protocol.

5. need a way of packing the correct contents <rev-list-args> for the bundle as --all is over-sharing _all_ the local refs (in remotes etc): e.g. --bundle, --clone, --bundle-clone, --clone-bundle (the new option in index-pack)...

6. 'bundle verify' will need to learn the new arrangements. (and also (4) HEAD disambiguation when implemented).

(7). the .pack approach is neat (with respect to placing it in .git/objects/, rather than adjacent to the .bndl.

(8). Junio's explanation of where it's at at the moment.

9. (again) Must not break existing bundle method (ease of getting the bundle's parts)
