"Updates files in the working tree to match the version in the index or the specified tree. "

Doesn't say how the update is done....





git checkout -b|-B <new_branch> [<start point>]

    Specifying -b causes a new branch to be created as if git-branch(1) were called and then checked out. In this case you can use the --track or --no-track options, which will be passed to git branch. As a convenience, --track without -b implies branch creation; see the description of --track below.

    If -B is given, <new_branch> is created if it doesn’t exist; otherwise, it is reset. This is the transactional equivalent of

    $ git branch -f <branch> [<start point>]
    $ git checkout <branch>

    that is to say, the branch is not reset/created unless "git checkout" is successful.

git checkout -b|-B <new_branch> [<start point>]

    Specifying -b causes a new branch to be created as if git-branch(1) were called and then **the <start point> (or HEAD) will be** //checked out//merged in//. In this case you can use the --track or --no-track options, which will be passed to git branch. As a convenience, --track without -b implies branch creation; see the description of --track below.

** Where the worktree contains existing changes then the <start point> (OR head) will be merged with those changes.

** To create a branch that starts with the current work tree (rather than merging in HEAD), use 'git symbolic-ref`. 
E.g. git alias branchout(): git branch $1; git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/$1
`git config --global alias.branchout '!sh -c 'git branch $1; git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/$1'
`git config --global alias.branchout '!f() {git branch $1; git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/$1};f'

    If -B is given, <new_branch> is created if it doesn’t exist; otherwise, it is reset. This is the transactional equivalent of

    $ git branch -f <branch> [<start point>]
    $ git checkout <branch>

    that is to say, the branch is not reset/created unless "git checkout" is successful.
