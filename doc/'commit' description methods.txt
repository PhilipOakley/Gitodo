When a <commit> can be given in a command we can use any/many of the ways of specifying a revision, e.g. the :/<msg> method
and various others that have the <sha1>.

This came up with the --fixup= commit command which creates a 'fixup! <msg>' for the target.

and then there is -m"<msg>" method and then the -autosquash effect in the rebase (layers on layers)

The main point is to sprinkle around the docs the examples that use these alternate methods of speciying the commit.



search for documenation that has <commit> in the description.

search fro doc that link to "gitrevisions" (i.e. how to specify them)
