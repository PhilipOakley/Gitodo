refspec
=======

should (maybe) be included in 'specifying revisions' gitrevisions.txt,

but it's hidden in pull-fetch-param.txt which is embedded in:
 git-fetch and
 git-pull 

While refspec is mentioned in many other places as well

config.txt
fetch-options.txt
git-check-ref-format
git-checkout
git-clone
git-cvsserver
git-push
git-remote
git-show-branch
git-svn
gitremote-helpers (maybe renamed in newer versions, 'cos of the missing hyphen)
glossary-contents.txt
pull-fetch-param.txt
urls-remotes.txt
user-manual.txt

(plus the two at the top)
