typical merge conflict message during a 'git rebase -i'
====
When you have resolved this problem, run "git rebase --continue".
If you prefer to skip this patch, run "git rebase --skip" instead.
To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run "git rebase --abort".

====

1. "resolve" includes the 'git add' but not the 'git commit' (the latter is done by continue)
2. clarify whether --skip will remove merge conflicts or do they get left.

Also update the docs to clarify (using a common style, rather than shifting style)
