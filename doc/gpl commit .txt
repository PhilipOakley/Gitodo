Git doc: GPL2 does not apply to repo data

Some potential commercial users may be put off by the FUD
(Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) that has been raised in the past
regarding the use of FOSS software.

In such communities, even the legal advice may be misinformed
and over-cautious regarding the storage of code and other
intellectual property in a Git repository for fear that Git's
GPL2 licence may somehow 'infect' the respository.

Add simple statements highlighting Git's licence, it's use
for Linux, to imply industrial-strength, and that users should
apply a suitable licence of their choice because the Git GPL
licence does not apply to their repo data.

It should be noted that a 'git init' will create a repo that while
empty of user data does provide the .git directory structure includes
a number of template files ('hooks\pre-rebase.sample' is explicitly
copyright), default refs and config file. Some may suggest that these
carry the GPL2 to the repo.

The GPL2 will still apply to the hook templates and the other
template files, but these, even if modified (becoming derived works)
would be distributed with the repo, satisfying the GPL.

The new content copyright belongs to user. Request that they state
their licence terms in line with recent FOSS industry practice.
